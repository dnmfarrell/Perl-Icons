=head1 Perl Icons

This repo contains SVG images of icons associated with the Perl programming language. Because they are SVG, the icons can be easily embedded in a font icon file and used as Glyphs on a web page.

I'm licensing the icons under the FreeBSD license but be aware that the icons themselves may be subject to additional restrictions on use:
